      I started building websites and software 15 years ago, and I've loved
      every minute of it. Throughout my career I've developed projects on my own
      for small businesses, and collaborated with talented people to create
      digital products for large corporations. I'm naturally curious, quietly
      hard working, and perpetually working on improving my skills one coding
      problem at a time.
